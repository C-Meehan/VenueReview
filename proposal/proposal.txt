Project Name - Venue Review

Project Description - I love going to different sporting events and experiencing a day at the park. Sometimes when going to a new stadium you're not sure what to expect. My solo project is a stadium review site. Users will be able to log in, review venues they've been to previously, and check out reviews of other venues that they are planning on visiting.

MVP features - Login and Registration components. Dashboard displaying all stadiums with overall review score. A profile page displaying user's reviews. A Stadium page displaying stadium information, reviews of that stadium, and a review form for that stadium. An edit review page for a user to edit a specific stadium review. 

Bonus Features - Working Login/Registration with validations and implementation of some Bootstrap/MaterialUI
